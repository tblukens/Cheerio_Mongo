#### Once you load up the application it's very easy to use.

#### On the main page simply click the SCRAPE ARTICLES button to load scrape article information from PCGAMER news and it will save the article information to your mongo database.

#### You can then click links to view the articles, or save the articles for later.

#### You can then access each article by clicking the Save Article button. This will allow you to view it on the Saved Articles page.

#### If you click on the saved articles page it will allow you to view all saved articles. Once there you can clear the article from the saved section or view the articles notes.

#### When in the article view section once clicking on notes you will be able to see all notes associated with the chosen article. You can also add notes of your own and click the add comment button to submit them!
